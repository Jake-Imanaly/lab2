        <h3> Training style</h3>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Golovkin is known for his hard sparring sessions, in which he often sparred with much larger opponents. His biggest sparring partner was a heavyweight, "Vicious" Vincent Thompson, who was a 243 lb prospect with a 13–0 professional record at the time.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Golovkin's ex-trainer Abel Sanchez praised him for his work ethic and humbleness: "He has been that way since I first got him eight years ago. He is humble and shy guy, like you see him now, and it's actually pretty pleasant to be around somebody like that, who's not just 'foam at the mouth' and trying to say who he's gonna kill next." </td></tr>
